# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FIX REQUIRED - URL Mismatch Detected

## **Problem Identified**

Your current Lovable URL: `https://preview--organize-prime.lovable.app/`

Your Google Cloud Console URLs are **COMPLETELY WRONG**:
- Currently configured: `https://1e6ce6bf-a04e-4729-b11c-343e6c696d45.lovableproject.com`
- Should be: `https://preview--organize-prime.lovable.app`

## **STEP 1: Fix Google Cloud Console (URGENT)**

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Edit your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
3. **REPLACE ALL URLs**:

   **Authorized JavaScript origins:**
   ```
   DELETE: https://1e6ce6bf-a04e-4729-b11c-343e6c696d45.lovableproject.com
   ADD: https://preview--organize-prime.lovable.app
   ```

   **Authorized redirect URIs:**
   ```
   DELETE: https://1e6ce6bf-a04e-4729-b11c-343e6c696d45.lovableproject.com/auth/callback
   ADD: https://preview--organize-prime.lovable.app/auth/callback
   ```

4. **SAVE** the changes

## **STEP 2: Update Supabase URLs**

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cjwgfoingscquolnfkhh/auth/url-configuration)
2. Update these fields:
   - **Site URL**: `https://preview--organize-prime.lovable.app`
   - **Redirect URLs**: `https://preview--organize-prime.lovable.app/auth/callback`
3. **Save configuration**

## **STEP 3: Clear Browser State**

Open browser console on `https://preview--organize-prime.lovable.app/` and run:
```javascript
// Clear all OAuth state
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();

// Reload the page
location.reload();
```

## **STEP 4: Test Google OAuth**

1. Go to `https://preview--organize-prime.lovable.app/auth`
2. Click "Google" sign in
3. Should now work without "Missing authorization code" error

## **Component Error Fix**

The `admin-features-DEYboYh4.js` error is caused by a React component import issue. This should be resolved by the optimized files I've already updated in your repository.

If you still see the blank screen after the OAuth fix:

1. **Hard refresh** the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Clear browser cache** completely
3. **Try incognito mode**

---

## **Why This Happened**

The old URLs in your Google Cloud Console were from a previous Lovable project. When Lovable projects are redeployed or moved, they get new URLs, but the OAuth configuration wasn't updated to match.

**This is the #1 cause of OAuth failures** - exact URL matching is required for security.

---

## **Verification**

After making these changes:
âœ… Google OAuth should work perfectly  
âœ… No more "Missing authorization code" errors  
âœ… App should load normally without blank screens  
âœ… All authentication flows should be functional  

The URL mismatch was preventing OAuth from working entirely, which was cascading into other loading issues.
